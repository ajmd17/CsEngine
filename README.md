# ApexEngine
Apex Engine is a 3D game engine created in C#. It uses OpenTK for access to OpenGL functions.
Has an intuitive scene editor and a material editor. 

Supported features:

  - Scene graph
  - Supporting for loading OBJ and Ogre XML model formats
  - Physics (thanks to Jitter Physics Library)
  - Physically based lighting
  - Cascaded Shadow mapping
  - Post processing effects (such as SSAO)
  - Dynamic/Procedural terrain
  - Model/scene exporting in an xml format
  
  And some more, however it's hard to remember on the spot...
  
Planned features:

  - 2D support (I had it incorporated into the Java version, I just need the time to put it back together!)
  - Mesh editing in the scene editor
  - Material node editor
  - More cool post processing effects such as screen-space reflections
  - Collada (.dae) model support
